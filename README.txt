The documentations has been generated and can be found in the docs folder. 

However, if it fails to load, navigate to the src folder and run ./remake_docs.ps1. This step must be performed in the virtual environment created in ./reset_venv.ps1 as it uses some dependencies in that folder.

The documentation will be generated in docs/_build/html in the src folder.
